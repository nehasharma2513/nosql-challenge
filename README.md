#Eat Safe, Love 
## Food hygiene rating analysis for establishments across the United Kingdom,
 
As a part of this project we are going to evaluate some of the ratings data of various establishments in order to help Eat Safe, Love magazine's journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

The project is divided into two major steps :
1. Setup and Database update (NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb)
      1. In this notebook, database connection is made and a new restaurant "Penang Flavours" has been added to the Database.
      2. Database is updated to add BusinessTypeID for the newly added restaurant
      3. Records from Dover Local Authority were deleted from the database
      4. Datatype is updated for few fields : latitude and longitude to decimal numbers; RatingValue to integer
        
2. Exploratory Analysis (NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb)
